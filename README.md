# Chittr

Chittr is a mobile application developed using React Native. The aim of the application is to create a new form of social media. Like twitter, users can post chits and the entire application is mobile.
The application has a login page, and a account creation page. The application also contains a chit feed, which shows all users chits. The application also allows users to follow other users and unfollow users. Features that have been recently added include being able to search for users
